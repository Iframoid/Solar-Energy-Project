# Project Overview: Solar Panel Installation Analysis in California

## Objective
The objective of this project is to assess the financial viability of installing solar panels on a large scale in California. The analysis focuses on determining the potential benefits, cost savings, and return on investment (ROI) associated with installing solar panels on suitable buildings in the state.

## Data Source
The project utilizes data from the `bigquery-public-data.sunroof_solar` dataset, specifically the `solar_potential_by_postal_code` table. This dataset contains valuable information about the solar potential of buildings in different states.

## Key Metrics
1. **Total Suitable Buildings in California:** The analysis identifies a total of 8,607,224 buildings in California suitable for solar panel installation.
2. **Dollars Saved Per Year in California:** The project estimates the yearly savings in dollars, considering the solar potential of the identified buildings. The calculation is based on an assumed energy conversion rate and current energy costs.
3. **Net Profit Calculation:** The net profit is determined by subtracting the total estimated cost of solar panel installation from the total dollars saved per year.
4. **ROI Percentage:** The ROI percentage is calculated to assess the financial return on the investment in solar panels. It is expressed as a percentage and provides insights into the profitability of the project.

## Assumptions
- The estimated cost per solar panel installation is set at $10,000.
- The energy savings are calculated based on an assumed conversion rate and energy cost.

## Results
1. **Negative Net Profit:** The analysis reveals a negative net profit, indicating that the total estimated savings may not cover the initial cost of solar panel installation.
2. **Negative ROI Percentage:** The ROI percentage is calculated at -66.14%, suggesting that the financial return on the investment is unfavorable.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the current scenario suggests that the assumed investment in solar panels for the specified number of buildings in California may not be economically viable. The negative ROI and net profit raise concerns about the financial feasibility of the project.

This project provides valuable insights into the economic aspects of large-scale solar panel installations, emphasizing the importance of accurate cost assessments for informed decision-making.
